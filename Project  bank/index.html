                        <h3>Recive money in any currency with no fees</h3>
                        <p>the world is getting smaller and we're becoming more mobile. So why should you be forced to only recive money in a single ...

                            was not yet poor. Both were just starting out on their careers, and 
                            both were struggling with money and families. But they had very 
                            different points of view about money.
                            For example, one dad would say, “The love of money is the root 
                            of all evil.” The other said, “The lack of money is the root of all evil.”
                            As a young boy, having two strong fathers both influencing me 
                            was difficult. I wanted to be a good son and listen, but the two fathers 
                            did not say the same things. The contrast in their points of view, 
                            particularly about money, was so extreme that I grew curious and 
                            intrigued. I began to start thinking for long periods of time about 
                            what each was saying.
                            Much of my private time was spent reflecting, asking myself 
                            questions such as, “Why does he say that?” and then asking the same 
                            question of the other dad’s statement. It would have been much 
                            easier to simply say, “Yeah, he’s right. I agree with that.” Or to simply 
                            reject the point of view by saying, “The old man doesn’t know what 
                            he’s talking about.” Instead, having two dads whom I loved forced 
                            me to think and ultimately choose a way of thinking for myself. As a 
                            process, choosing for myself turned out to be much more valuable in 
                            the long run than simply accepting or rejecting a single point of view.
                            One of the reasons the rich get richer, the poor get poorer, and 
                            the middle class struggles in debt is that the subject of money is 
                            taught at home, not in school. Most of us learn about money from 
                            our parents. So what can poor parents tell their child about money? 
                            They simply say, “Stay in school and study hard.” The child may 
                            graduate with excellent grades, but with a poor person’s financial 
                            programming and mindset.
                            Sadly, money is not taught in schools. Schools focus on scholastic 
                            and professional skills, but not on financial skills. This explains how 
                            smart bankers, doctors, and accountants who earned excellent grades 
                            may struggle financially all of their lives. Our staggering national debt 
                            is due in large part to highly educated politicians and government 
                            officials making financial decisions with little or no training in the
                            subject of money.

                        <h3>Recive money in any currency with no fees</h3>
                        <p>the world is getting smaller and we're becoming more mobile. So why should you be forced to only recive money in a single ...
                            was not yet poor. Both were just starting out on their careers, and 
both were struggling with money and families. But they had very 
different points of view about money.
For example, one dad would say, “The love of money is the root 
of all evil.” The other said, “The lack of money is the root of all evil.”
As a young boy, having two strong fathers both influencing me 
was difficult. I wanted to be a good son and listen, but the two fathers 
did not say the same things. The contrast in their points of view, 
particularly about money, was so extreme that I grew curious and 
intrigued. I began to start thinking for long periods of time about 
what each was saying.
Much of my private time was spent reflecting, asking myself 
questions such as, “Why does he say that?” and then asking the same 
question of the other dad’s statement. It would have been much 
easier to simply say, “Yeah, he’s right. I agree with that.” Or to simply 
reject the point of view by saying, “The old man doesn’t know what 
he’s talking about.” Instead, having two dads whom I loved forced 
me to think and ultimately choose a way of thinking for myself. As a 
process, choosing for myself turned out to be much more valuable in 
the long run than simply accepting or rejecting a single point of view.
One of the reasons the rich get richer, the poor get poorer, and 
the middle class struggles in debt is that the subject of money is 
taught at home, not in school. Most of us learn about money from 
our parents. So what can poor parents tell their child about money? 
They simply say, “Stay in school and study hard.” The child may 
graduate with excellent grades, but with a poor person’s financial 
programming and mindset.
Sadly, money is not taught in schools. Schools focus on scholastic 
and professional skills, but not on financial skills. This explains how 
smart bankers, doctors, and accountants who earned excellent grades 
may struggle financially all of their lives. Our staggering national debt 
is due in large part to highly educated politicians and government 
officials making financial decisions with little or no training in the
subject of money.
